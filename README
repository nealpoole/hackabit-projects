- bitly-file-storage: PHP-based CLI tools.
	= Uploads files in base64 encoded chunks to bit.ly.
	= Creates a binary tree data-structure to link the chunks together, resulting in a single bit.ly URL that can be used for downloading
	= Downloading is as simple as a depth-first traversal of the tree using bit.ly's API
	= Uses the PHP client library for bit.ly from http://classes.verkoyen.eu/bitly/

Thanks to Paul Kernfeld (http://paulkernfeld.com/) for brainstorming the idea with me. :-)
